\chapter{Annotations}

Annotations are tools that are used to add dimensions and other notes to a 3D model. In general, this approach is known as Model-Based Definition, and allows you to convey all the necessary information about a model without having to generate 2D sketches. Once you add annotations, they can be found in the Model Browser under the relevant folders.

\section{Tolerances}

When doing 3D modelling work, it is almost always necessary to incorporate tolerances to account for machining imprecisions.
