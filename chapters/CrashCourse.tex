\chapter{Crash Course: Top 20 Takeaways}

\begin{itemize}
\item Combine 2D profiles by using the Intersection Curve tool under 3D Sketch. This lets you create complex surfaces from only a side and top view of the object in question.
\item Projecting geometry is a vital skill
\item Utilising inferred constraints and snapping geometry to points will make your worflow exponentially faster.
\item Use the Automatic Dimension tool!
\item Parameters are very useful
\item Know the process of downloading CAD files and creating components around them
\item The Shape Generator can be very useful for advanced projects
\item If you can, use Design Accelerators
\item Don't forget that Inventor stores a wide array of physical properties
\item Know how to suppress and hide features
\end{itemize}
