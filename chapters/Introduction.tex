\section{About This Guide}

This Lookup Guide aims to provide a comprehensive summary of all the capabilities of Autodesk Inventor. It has been developed by UQ MARS with the intention of broadening the awareness around CAD software without providing a guide so detailed that it is hard to absorb the knowledge. It is not intended as a resource to teach students how to use CAD, and it is recommended that students attend the offered CAD Workshop if they are completely new to the softwares. Instead, this is aimed towards students with an intermediate background in CAD - they are are able to utilise its basic functionality, but are not aware of the breadth of tools offered. This guide will aim to give a broad understanding of Autodek Inventor's various tools and in what applications they can be benefited from. It should be used as a reference guide to determine whether Autodesk Inventor has the required functionality and specific resources will be recommended for those who wish to use these tools. It should be noted that, although this guide is for Autodesk Inventor, most of the features presented will also be available in other software packages.
